# Face Recognition System using Teacher-Student Model
This project implements a lightweight face recognition and forgery detection system using a **Teacher-Student model**. It is designed using **Object-Oriented Analysis and Design (OOAD)** principles and aims to detect deepfake images through early convolutional features and residual learning.

# Features
- Upload and align user face images.
- Use Teacher model (heavyweight) for initial training.
- Use Student model (lightweight) to simulate genuine face patterns.
- Detect forged images by measuring student-teacher output divergence.
- Store and retrieve face detection logs in the database.

# System Arcitecture
- Implemented based on OOAD process:
- Requirement Analysis
- Use Case Modeling
- Object-Oriented Analysis & Design
- Sequence Diagrams
